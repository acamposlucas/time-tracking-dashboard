## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this dashboard and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you would like to practice working with JSON data, we provide a local `data.json` file for the activities. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the content in the `.html` file.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Switch between viewing Daily, Weekly, and Monthly stats

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenged taught me how to use data from JSON file to create elements in HTML, which was the reason I took it.
But I also improved my skills on creating responsive Grid containers.

### Continued development

I will look up to adapt this challenge to tablet screens and fix its accessibility issues.

### Useful resources

- [Grizhlie Codes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l9Qw8y3LfCY&t) - This solution helped me understand how to manipulate JSON data even though it does not use Fetch API.
- [Como consumir uma API...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imk6Y0viabg) - This video teaches how to use function async/await to manipulate JSON data.
